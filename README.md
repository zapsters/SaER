# SaER Website!

This project was expanded to be more than just the SaER console. Now there is a whole SaER site! This is basically just a site I would like to build for fun. I need to go study for my Statistics final, so updates to come. 

VERSION 3.0: Expanded and Enhanced :P

ToDo: 
  (-) Adding Lore lol
  (-) Add project content.
  (-) SaER Staff list (recreated because I lost it in my google drive some where).
