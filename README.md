# SaER Console!

link: https://zapsters.github.io/SaER/

I had the idea to make the SaER a whole thing with the console included, but I have changed it back to just the console. I like it much better with it being a simple console. 

ToDo: <br>
 (+) Revamp the OPEN command to show some spicy info on SaER projects. This is da lore part. <br>
 (+) Remove the variable command? It is cool, but like I don't see a lot of use for it. It is on the chopping block for now. <br>
